It demands expertise in areas ranging from dataset creation and feature engineering to model tuning, evaluation, and deployment. This blog post will walk you through the key stages involved in AI development, explain the importance of each, and provide a clear understanding of the skills required at different levels of expertise, namely Junior, Senior, and Staff Engineer.</description></item><item><title>The Role of Negative Mining in Machine Learning: Bridging the Gap in Model Performance</title><link>https://viig99.github.io/docs/posts/hard_negatives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://viig99.github.io/docs/posts/hard_negatives/</guid><description>Introduction # Machine learning models are excellent tools for making predictions or classifications. However, they&amp;rsquo;re not infallible; occasionally, they may make mistakes. Some of the most enlightening mistakes are the so-called &amp;ldquo;hard negatives&amp;rdquo; â€” instances where the model confidently produces the incorrect output. Understanding and learning from these instances through hard negative mining can significantly improve the model&amp;rsquo;s performance.
Understanding Hard Negative Mining # In machine learning, &amp;ldquo;hard negatives&amp;rdquo; refer to examples that are challenging for the model to classify correctly.</description></item></channel></rss>
