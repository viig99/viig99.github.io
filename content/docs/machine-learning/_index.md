## **Machine Learning Toolkit**

### **Data Engineering**
* Building robust unbiased datasets using feature based sampling methods.
* Generating Synthetic data similar to data distribution.
* Augmentation techniques for various modalities like vision, speech, nlp.

### **Modelling and Feature Engineering**
* Knowledge of Convolution, Recurrent and Transformer based models.
* Feature importance techniques
* Contrastive Learning methods like SimCLR, BYOL, SimSiam.
* Model Debugging & Profiling.

### **Training**
* Distributed Training on clusters using OpenMPI + RoCE, Torch RPC
* Pytorch Lightning optimizations.

### **Calibration**
* Implicit Calibration techniques like Focal Loss, Maximum Entropy Regularization, Label Smoothing, Random Dropout etc.
* Explicit Calibration techniques like Isotonic Regression, Patt's scaling

### **Optimizations**
* Quantization
* Model Pruning
* Distillation
* ML Ops Fusing techniques like ONNX, TorchDynamo, TVM etc

### **Inference**
* C++ Inference using ONNX & Drogon
* Frameworks like Triton, Mosec.
* Scaling on k8 using OKD.
* Monitoring & Alerting using Vector.io + Prometheous + Grafana.

### **Online Monitoring**
* Hard Negative mining around calibrated threshold region.
* Sampling and saving hard negatives
* Monitoring and alerts to detect Model & Data Drifts.
