However, they&amp;rsquo;re not infallible; occasionally, they may make mistakes. Some of the most enlightening mistakes are the so-called &amp;ldquo;hard negatives&amp;rdquo; â€” instances where the model confidently produces the incorrect output. Understanding and learning from these instances through hard negative mining can significantly improve the model&amp;rsquo;s performance.
Understanding Hard Negative Mining # In machine learning, &amp;ldquo;hard negatives&amp;rdquo; refer to examples that are challenging for the model to classify correctly.</description></item></channel></rss>
